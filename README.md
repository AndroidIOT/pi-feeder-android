# Pi Feeder Android

This is a basic mobile client for my [Pi Feeder project](https://github.com/afollestad/pi-feeder).

This app is both a native experience (left), and a web experience (right):

The native experience allows you to discover Pi Feeder devices on your network, login, and perform
basic actions like manually activating the feeder and toggling SMS notifications. You can open the
web dashboard to manage your feeding schedule and account.
